# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the analysis
  The current analysis was prepared for a young entrepreneur and their potential investor. The business objective is to open a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. To ensure the sustainability of the business year-round I prepared summary statistics for the June and December temperatures. 
  
## Results
  Table 1 - June Results ![This is an image](https://github.com/OlgaOMir/surfs_up/blob/main/June_Summay.png)
  
  Table 2 - December Results ![This is an image](https://github.com/OlgaOMir/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec_Summary.png)
  
  As illustrated above, here are three main differences in weather between June and December: 
  
  - December standard deviation is higher compared to June
  - temperatures in December are a little cooler compared to June
  - min temperature for December is significantly lower, which contributes to the higher std
  
## Summary

Based on the results of this analysis the temperatures on the island stay pretty stable throughout the year and there is not much deferences between the summary statistics for the month of June and December. I would advise to perform the following queries to gather more data for both months as it will help with creating a more accurate picture for the stakeholders: 

  - summary statistics of percipitation
  - hazardous weather summary
